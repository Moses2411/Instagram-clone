to activate my virtual enviroment i used the following command in my project directory: env\Scripts\activate.
After activating the virtual enviroment, i started my fast api on the local host 8000 using the following command: uvicorn main:app --reload to refresh the API after saving any changes.
I also accessed the swagger documentation by appending a '/docs' on the url generated by the above command.
I tested the following end points:
(1) Post endpoint under the user router where i defined a create function to create new a user, i had some internal errors but after applying correctinons, i was able to create a new user.
(2) Post endpoint to create a caption and a photo under the post router, i created a new post and the photo apeared in my images folder created in my project route.
(3) get endpoint to get a post and to delete a post by it's ID this endpoint was created under the post router. After applying it, all the posts i creatd appeared with 200 ok response.
(4) post endpoint inside the authentiation router.  This is where i was abble to log in with the password and ser name i used to create a user as described above. I also experienced a few comlexity here, but it finally worked.
(5) Post endpoint inside the comment router. I used this endpoint to create a comment having logged in and afterwards i used the Get endpoint inside thesame router to be able to see the comment i made under a specific post using a specific ID
